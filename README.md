# MultiAgentSystems
Simulates a group of many agents moving to some target formation.


I began this project June 2018 as a participant in the Center for Discreet Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science's (DIMACS) Reserach Experience for Undergraduate program.

My mentor, Dr. Jinjin Yu publishe the formation control policy used in this simulation, which optimizes the distance travelled by agents while also providing a tight upper bound for completion time. 

I'm using this algorithm to implement a variety of group tasks to be accomplished by the agents, for instance: surrounding & capturing a target, patrolling an area/perimeter, dispersion, or any combination of these
	
As of now, the simulation gives one the option for agents to travel to randomly generated target positions or to surround a target with a variety of radii. 

Perimeter patrol coming soon ^.^
